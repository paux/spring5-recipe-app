[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/paux/spring5-recipe-app.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/paux/spring5-recipe-app)

This repository is for an example application built in the _Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru_ course.
You can learn about the Spring Framework 5 online course [here](https://go.springframework.guru/spring-framework-5-online-course).

Following along the course, I built up my personal [Spring Framework Cheat-Sheet](Spring-CheatSheet.md).
